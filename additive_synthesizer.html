    <h1>Additive Synthesizer Component</h1>
    <p><strong>Developed by:</strong> Your Name</p>

    <h2>Functionality Description</h2>
    <p>The additive synthesizer generates sound by summing sinusoidal waves at harmonic frequencies. It supports the following features:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Harmonics:</strong> Allows specifying amplitudes for multiple harmonics.</li>
        <li><strong>Envelope Generation:</strong> Implements ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope shaping.</li>
        <li><strong>Vibrato:</strong> Modulates the pitch with specified rate and depth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Grading Elements Supported</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement a synthesizer component that is controlled by the score and generates sound by additive synthesis.</li>
        <li>Implement envelope generation controlled by the score.</li>
        <li>Implement vibrato controlled by the score.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Audio Demonstration</h2>
    <p>The audio file demonstrating the additive synthesizer can be found <a href="additive_demo.wav">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Description: This audio sample showcases the additive synthesizer generating notes with specified harmonics, envelope, and vibrato.</p>
